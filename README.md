# YTLite

A lightweight YouTube client for iOS 12+ built entirely with UIKit. No ads, no tracking, no dependencies.

## Why

When Google dropped support for the official YouTube app on older devices, there was no way to watch videos properly. Browsers capped quality at 360p — and even that barely ran. YTLite was born to restore what was lost: high-quality playback on hardware that still works fine, just ignored by Google. The "Lite" stands for a focused, lightweight client that does one thing well — let you watch YouTube.

> **Note:** This project is not related to [dayanch96/YTLite](https://github.com/dayanch96/YTLite) (YouTube Plus). The name collision is accidental.

## Features

- **Video Playback** — up to 1080p 60fps quality
- **Background Audio** — Continue listening with the screen off
- **Picture-in-Picture** — Watch while using other apps
- **SponsorBlock** — Skip sponsored segments automatically
- **Return YouTube Dislike** — See dislike counts again
- **Subtitles** — Full subtitle/caption support with VTT parsing
- **Search & Browse** — Home feed, trending, channel pages, playlists
- **Subscriptions** — Follow channels with a local subscription feed
- **Watch History** — Track what you've watched with progress indicators, synced across devices
- **Autoplay** — Automatically play the next related video
- **Dark/Light Theme** — Manual theme switching via ThemeManager

## How to Use

YTLite runs on devices with **iOS 12 and above**.

### Jailbroken devices

Install the `.ipa` package directly:
- **Filza** — open the `.ipa` file → Install
- **ReProvision** — sign and install the IPA from the app

### Non-jailbroken devices

**Option 1 — Add source (recommended)**

Add the YTLite source to your sideloading app to receive automatic updates:

[![Add Source](https://github.com/StikStore/altdirect/raw/main/assets/png/AltSource_Blue.png?raw=true)](https://stikstore.app/altdirect/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/verback2308/YTLite/main/source/apps.json)

**Option 2 — Manual install**

Download the IPA and install via **SideStore**, **AltStore**, or **LiveContainer**.

**Option 3 — Build from source**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/verback2308/YTLite.git
cd YTLite
cp Config/Local.xcconfig.example Config/Local.xcconfig
./make_ipa.sh
```

## Known Issues and Limitations

- Kids content is not available — the current API source does not return it; may be added later
- Audio track selection is not possible (same API limitation)
- Playback speeds above 2x may cause issues
- **Shorts** are not natively supported — they are treated as regular videos, but can be hidden from the subscriptions feed
- Comments are displayed as a flat read-only list
- Offline download is not yet available

## Bug Reports

If you encounter a bug, you can export debug logs directly from the app:

**Settings → Debug → Share Debug Log**

This generates a log file you can attach to your GitHub issue. The log includes timestamped playback, API, and caching events that help diagnose problems.

## Building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/verback2308/YTLite.git
cd YTLite
cp Config/Local.xcconfig.example Config/Local.xcconfig
open YTLite.xcodeproj
```

Edit `Config/Local.xcconfig` and set your own `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER`.

Select the **YTVLite** scheme, choose your device or simulator, and build (⌘B).

### Key Design Decisions

- **Zero external dependencies** — Networking via a custom `HTTPTransport` abstraction over `URLSession`, images via custom `ThumbnailImageView`, playback via `AVPlayer`
- **All UIKit, no SwiftUI** — Programmatic layout, no storyboards
- **iOS 12+ support** — No SF Symbols, no SwiftUI, no Combine
- **Manual JSON parsing** — `JSONSerialization` + dictionary traversal for YouTube Innertube API responses
- **Dependency injection** — `ServiceContainer` provides services; view controllers receive dependencies via initializers

### Playback Pipeline

Playback is built on a single `VideoSource` abstraction — each way of playing a video implements the same interface and owns both stream resolution and quality selection. `PlaybackFacade` just asks a factory for the configured source, calls `loadPlayback`, and hands the prepared `AVPlayerItem` to the player shell. Three sources exist:

1. **Android VR** *(default)* — Streams via YouTube's Innertube API; adaptive formats (360p–1080p) are converted from DASH SIDX byte ranges into an HLS playlist for native `AVPlayer`, with progressive/native-HLS fallbacks.
2. **Progressive** — Direct 360p MP4 URL for the restricted case (e.g. server-side A/B experiments).
3. **WebView HLS** — Extracts an authenticated HLS manifest (resolving the `n` throttling signature on-device or via a remote solver), then proxies segments through a custom `AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate` for full 144p–1080p quality selection.

Quality selection is source-agnostic: the player UI simply renders whatever qualities the active source reports. Background audio is `AVAudioSession`-based and works across all sources.

### Authentication

OAuth device-code flow: the app requests a device code → user enters it at google.com/device → tokens are stored in Keychain. Anonymous browsing is supported.

## Project Structure

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `InnertubeClient` | YouTube API: browse, search, player, comments, subscriptions |
| `PlaybackFacade` | Selects a `VideoSource` via factory, loads it, and drives player setup |
| `VideoPlayerView` | Custom player UI with controls, gestures, PiP |
| `WatchViewController` | Watch page: player + metadata + comments + related |
| `AppCache` | Dual-layer cache (memory + disk) with TTL |
| `SponsorBlockController` | SponsorBlock API integration |
| `ThemeManager` | App-wide theming (dark/light) |
